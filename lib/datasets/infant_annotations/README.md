The `train` split contains all 10000 images from the MINI-RGBD 01 - 10 splits.

`SyRIP_all.npy` contains the annotations for the SyRIP infant dataset partitioned into three splits: `train`, `test`, and `prior`. The `test` split contains all 500 images from the SyRIP `validation` directory, respectivey. The `train` and `prior` splits consist of the synthetic and real images from the SyRIP `train` directory, respectively.
